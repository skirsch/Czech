# USAGE
# python buckets.py <src_file.csv> <optional prefix> <optional vax count> <optional fitler flag>
# src_file.csv is the file you want processed, has to be in the format of the NZ data
# prefix - as a prefix to the output files and also for the pickle cache
# vax count - only process people with exactly a certain number of doses
# filter flag - 'FILTER' if you want to filter people who may have skipped a dose
