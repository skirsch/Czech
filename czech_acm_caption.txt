Czech ACM Data: No Vaccine Mortality Benefit
FOIA-derived data (8,732 deaths, millions of person-weeks) shows no differential benefit: 
both cohorts exhibit ~1.49x ACM increase from low to high COVID periods, with a stable 
~3.3 unvaccinated/vaccinated ratio, contradicting an expected 1.13–1.5x unvaccinated spike 
(14.62% COVID deaths). 84.3% vaccinated cases in 2022 confirm no infection reduction.
